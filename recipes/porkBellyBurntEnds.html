    <h1>Pork Belly Burnt Ends</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pork belly burnt ends recipe is in my book "Black Smoke: African Americans and the United States of Barbecue." It comes courtesy of the Old Arthur Barbecue Sauce Company, which makes barbecue sauces and spice rubs based on recipes of Old Arthur Watts, who learned to barbecue while enslaved. Pork belly burnt ends are a riff on the traditional burnt ends made from beef brisket. This recipe calls for a 3-step process that candies the pork belly by smoking, rendering, and then adding barbecue sauce at the end of the smoking process.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>fruit wood or other wood pieces</li>
        <li>6 pounds pork belly, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
