# odin-recipes
## Aim
In this project, I aim to develop my baseline HTML framework skills to create a simple recipes website with multiple pages. I will use the various skills I've learned to implement on each web page.
## About
This project will consist of multiple web pages (recipes), and a home page interlinking them all. Initially this will be solely HTML until CSS is added at a later timeframe (stamped here in the readme).
